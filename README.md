## Project Synopsis 
In this project, we created a decentralized Discussion Forum where people can post their opinions and breaking news related to blockchain with details that too anonymously to inform the community.

<br>
Earlier, whistle-blowers had to go on the dark web to disclose information regarding these issues but on our platform every person would be able to disclose this info anonymously which would prevent any damange and endangerment to the person.

<br>
During the completion of this project we took into account the edge Solana has over other products in the market like it's super fast speed(about 400 milliseconds of blocking time), low cost(less than $0.01) and decentralized plus secure environment.
